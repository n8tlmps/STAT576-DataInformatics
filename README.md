# Data Informatics

## Homework 1
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
**Loading & Handling Data:** Load CSV files and manage datasets using tools like Python (pandas).
Feature Scaling: Standardize features for model compatibility using tools like StandardScaler in Python.
#### 2. Feature Selection Techniques
**Variance Threshold:** Filter features based on variance to remove irrelevant data (VarianceThreshold in Python).
**Multicollinearity Detection:** Use correlation matrices to remove highly correlated features.
**Random Forest Feature Importance:** Train a Random Forest and select features based on importance scores (RandomForestClassifier in Python).
**Linear Regression P-Value Selection:** Perform feature selection using p-values from linear regression (statsmodels in Python).
**L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Use Lasso for automatic feature selection by shrinking coefficients to zero (Lasso in Python).
#### 3. Modeling & Problem Solving
**Random Forest & Linear Regression:** Understand Random Forest and linear regression techniques, including regularization for feature selection.
**Efficient Code:** Implement solutions that balance model performance and computational efficiency.
#### 4. Documentation
**Code Readability & Reporting:** Write clear code and document results in Markdown or Jupyter notebooks for easy understanding and communication.
